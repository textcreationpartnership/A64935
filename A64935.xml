            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

I know many of both Religions, who never had it, upon either the one, or the other account; and it is certain, that ten times more of them would have been ſold, if the Book had been of the price and bigneſs of his firſt Work. And indeed, Sir, ſo big a Volume ſcareth people, and they dare not undertake to read it, that they may not be oblieged to quit it in the middle, and poſſibly

Beſides, Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, hath had but little care of our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, this Book being, in his opinion, and in that of his approbators, a plain and entire conviction of us, and an eaſie means to reduce us into the boſom of their Church, is it not true, Sir, That his zeal for ſo great a work ſhould have obliged him to have made it more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, more popular, more eaſie to buy, and to read it? What doth he know, whether of hundreds of perſons, who have not ſeen his Book, and who would have read it, if it had been much leſs, the half, or the third part, would not have been converted? What doth he know, whether <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> would not have repented, if they had ſeen the Miracles that have been done in <hi>Chorazim</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida?</hi> So that, methinks, he ſhould have ſo ordered it, either by a gratuitous impreſſion, or by retrenching three parts of four of his Book, that all ſorts of perſons might have got it.</p>
               <p>It may be, Sir, you will think this, what I ſay of a gratuitous Impreſſion, ſomewhat new and difficult to practiſe. But, if you conſider, that thoſe Gentlemen of the <hi>Port Royal</hi> have made above Five hundred preſents of this Book, according to the relation of their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, will not you avow to me, that, ſince the converſion of thoſe that ſhall read it is concerned, thoſe preſents would have been better employed for the Salvation of Men,

                  </gap>ied by Cuſtom, rather than by Inclination. And do not tell me, that this Book hath been given to Catholicks, to confirm them in their Religion: For you do not doubt, that almoſt none of thoſe, to whom it hath been preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had any need at all of theſe elucidations, nor any ſcruple of their Belief. You know alſo, that the Shepherd in the Goſpel leaves his Ninety and nine ſheep, of which he is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, to go and ſeek after that one which is gone aſtray. And if thoſe Gentlemen had pleaſed, they might have made Preſents, and given Alms, acquitted themſelves of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which reſpect and friendſhip demanded of them, and gained good will among their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. You ſee well enough, Sir, that I ſpeak for the intereſt of our people, and for many, who would have been very glad to have ſeen this Book, and were not in a condition to buy it, nor to read it after they had got it.</p>
               <p>But let us ſet aſide this Liberality and this Zeal; they are works of ſupererogation, to which a Man is not obliged; and when meer Counſels do cauſe trouble, pain, and ſome loſs, we do eaſily exempt our ſelves from them. But as to the ſecond condition, which I would have wiſhed from Monſieur <hi>Arnaud, viz.</hi> The ſhortning of his Book, to make it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41826:8"/> more common amongſt us, he cannot blame it foraſmuch as it would have turned both to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> would have taken off half his pains in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it, as well as that of ours in reading it.</p>
               <p>Do not think, Sir, that this retrenchment would have taken away any thing of the force of Monſieur <hi>Arnauds</hi> Book; on the contrary, it would have contained nothing but what is eſſential and ſolid, whereas in the condition it is now in, it may be ſaid in the general, that it is weak and uſeleſs throughout. For, it doth not bear it ſelf up equally; he often tells us one and the ſame thing, which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an amplification, and a paraphraſe of his Refutation; and he gives us ſeveral uſeleſs and impertinent diſcourſes. I believe, Sir, you your ſelf have perceived this truth, and it were not difficult to make it out to any who ſhould doubt of it. In ſhort, the firſt Book might be reduced to a Douzen Lines, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of the Twelve Chapters it contains. For, ſince it was onely written to <hi>Juſtifie the Method of the Book of the Perpetuity;</hi> that is to ſay, to Juſtifie, that the Author had not been obliged to anſwer to the whole Book of Monſieur <hi>Aubertin,</hi> and might have followed <hi>The way of Preſcription, rather than that of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion;</hi> It was ſufficient to obſerve ſo much in three or four words, ſince that is a matter of common ſenſe, and without controverſie: Nor hath Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> blamed that method

The firſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> touched but one word of it: Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> in his firſt writing had anſwered to it in Four Lines; in the refutation Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> did ſomewhat enlarge upon it; which did obliege Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> to make a longer anſwer thereto. But all that hath been hitherto done by ſlight touches, and as it were tranſiently; whereas now Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes it his principal. The thing is (and it is that which hath ſwelled the Work) that Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath not here taken Monſieur <hi>Claudes</hi> ſenſe aright, and labored to verifie that which was not denied him: For he pretends to prove every where, that Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> hath been in the wrong, in denying that the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches believe the <hi>Reality;</hi> and almoſt all the paſſages, which he alleageth, tend onely to make out the contrary.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Sixth may be reduced to a moſt certain, and moſt evident Propoſition, which is, That the words which expreſs what is to be believed of the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>have always been explained by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, either in a Literal Senſe, or in a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical Senſe, and that therefore the Church hath always diſtinctly believed, either the</hi> Real Preſence, <hi>or the</hi> Real Abſence. Theſe are the words of Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> in the <hi>Preface;</hi> whereupon he adds afterwards, <hi>That none other perhaps than Monſieur</hi> Claude <hi>would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged him to treat of this point, and that every man of good ſenſe muſt agree in it at firſt ſight.</hi> Whence you ſee, Sir, that inſtead of this Sixth Book, there needeth onely four or five Lines, according to the acknowledgment of Monſieur
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41826:10"/> 
                  <hi>Arnaud;</hi> and that the ſole wilfulneſs of Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> hath been the cauſe of this length. But if this wilfulneſs is imaginary, if Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> hath not onely agreed to, but alſo poſitively maintained, what Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> imputeth to him to have denied, is it not true, That we ought alſo to cut away this Sixth Book as uſeleſs, and ſuppoſing a thing which is not? But it is eaſie to verifie this laſt Propoſition, in the two parts of the Note of Monſieur <hi>Arnaud:</hi> One knows not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he accuſeth Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> for having denied the principle he puts, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; or, whether he accuſeth him onely for having denied the ſequel, although he agree about the principle; that is to ſay, One knows not, whether he will ſay, that Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> would not acknowledge that the words, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood,</hi> have been always taken in the Literal Senſe, or in the Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Senſe, and that conſequently Believers have always had a diſtinct belief of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> or <hi>Abſence Real?</hi> Or, whether he meant onely, that Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> agreeing about the <hi>Theſis,</hi> hath denied the Conſequence which Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> draws from it. For his words relate to both theſe parts; yet I will believe, that Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath onely thought of the Conſequence, ſince the whole Book of Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſpeaks of nothing elſe, but of the Metaphorial Senſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental words, and that particularly the fourth, fifth, and ſixth Chapters of the Second

               <p>But there is more than this, which is, that Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> fathers thoſe opinions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, which are none of ours, and goes about to decry our Religion from Conſequences, which he deviſeth at pleaſure, or which he borrows from thoſe, who have invented them.

Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> accuſeth our Morals to be deteſtable, and he doth no leſs concerning our Doctrine; ſince he affirms, <hi>That although the Trinity and all the other Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Faith be aſſerted by innumerable, very clear, and very convincing proofs both in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Tradition, yet theſe proofs ſound very ill in the mouths of the Calviniſts, who ſo weaken them by their falſe principles, that they make them incapable to perſwade the Socinians and all others that are in an error: And one may ſee, that theſe deteſtable Hereticks have done no more but advanced the principles, which the Calviniſts have furniſhed them with, by not enduring to be kept within thoſe arbitrary bounds, to which the firſt Reformers thought fit to confine themſelves: So that this Hereſie may in reaſon be called an Extenſion of Calviniſm.</hi> Thoſe falſe principles, of which he ſpeaks, are, <hi>That we renounce the Tradition and Authority of the Church, and that we reduce our ſelves to the Scripture alone, explained by our Reaſon, and by our private Spirit.</hi>

He will ſay, it may be, (and that is all that can be ſaid, ſomewhat to excuſe him;) That he meant not to charge us, as if we did formally maintain the errors of the Socinians about the <hi>Trinity,</hi> but onely, that we have the ſame principles concerning the Rules of our Faith; that both they and we reject the Authority of the Church; that without this Authority Heretickes cannot be convinced; and that thus, the Socinians being gone out from us, and even having driven farther, than we, this principle, that the Scripture alone is the Rule of Faith, we have furniſhed them with arms to fight againſt our moſt Sacred Myſteries.</p>

All that can be concluded from it, is, that we have that principle common; which ſignifies nothing, foraſmuch as there is no Hereſie, which hath not ſomething common with the true Church. And not to paſs out of our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Socinians believe and adore one onely God; they believe, and deſire Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; they believe and fear Hell, as well as we: Is it therefore to be ſaid, that we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hold their other Tenents, which we deteſt and oppoſe both, with all our power?

               <p>'Tis pretended, that this Change could not be made, becauſe the Oriental Churches had at that time the ſame belief which we now oppoſe, and which they could not receive from <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> nor the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> ſeeing they had perhaps never heard of the <hi>former,</hi> nor ſeen his Book, neither were they in a condition to receive from the latter any Change in their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, by reaſon of the animoſity which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe Churches; On the contrary, the Greeks would have been very glad to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd againſt the conduct of the Latins, if they had met with ſo fair an occaſion, ſince they declared and publiſht their demeanour in Writing about far ſlighter matters.</p>

               <p>The <hi>two laſt</hi> Propoſitions, drawn out of the paſſage of <hi>Nicephorus, viz.</hi> That the Bread and Wine are truely and properly the Body and Blood of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſuch by the vertue of the Holy Spirit, changing theſe Oblations into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, even as the Bread and Wine, and Water, are changed into our ſubſtance: Theſe two Propoſitions, I ſay, will appear to you more formal for your Belief, and more expreſs to prove the intention of M. <hi>Arnaud;</hi> But do not, I pray, ſtand upon the out-ſide, nor the Exterior ſenſe of theſe words; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them attentively, and you'l find, that theſe two opinions are as contrary to their Doctrine as to ours.</p>

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:41826:36"/> Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> was too candid not to own frankly, that the <hi>Latin</hi> Interpreters, which he followed, made him err, and that he ſhould have conſulted the <hi>Greek</hi> Text in an allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that conſequence: Yet you may ſee, that your conjecture would have been in vain, ſince Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> doth not yield to the truth which he ſeeth, but labors to confirm this Traduction by windings and turnings, and by ſubtleties unworthy a man of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and credit.</p>
               <p>Let us freely avow, Sir, that the ſpirit of man is a ſtrange piece; there is no evidence, he will not darken; no darkneſs, for which he will not pretend to finde light, when he findes himſelf engaged to maintain what he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and believeth, That it were a ſhame for him to retreat one ſtep in the face of his adverſary; but let us avow alſo, That <hi>truth</hi> hath an admirable power, and it ſhe be not always crowned by the hands of her own ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſhe is often oppoſed with ſo much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it is eaſie to ſee her advantage, and withal the perplexities entangling thoſe who reſiſt her motions.</p>
               <p>You ſee here a manifeſt example. Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> grants, that in the Text there is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, <hi>And then bending the knees three times;</hi> and that the word <hi>adoring</hi> is not there; and yet he goes about to maintain this Tranſlation. Is not this an effect of that ſelf-love, which caſts away many of the greateſt men, and which is never laid down but in our grave?
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41826:37"/> Can it be the ſole paſſion of conteſting with Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> even of the cleareſt things What may have obliged him to be obſtinate againſt ſuch an evidence? Can it be a defect of his underſtanding, and can he ſeriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a Tranſlator hath the liberty th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> it by a paraphraſe and an explication of his own phancy, under the pretence of having tranſlated it according to the Senſe, and not according to the Letter? Or can he believe, that <hi>to bend the knees,</hi> may be faithfully rendred by the word <hi>adore?</hi> You may make ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon it as you pleaſe; as for me, I am altogether perſwaded, that Monſieur <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> is deceived, and that he ſaith nothing to maintain his Propoſition, but what is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weak. But ſince I have not undertaken to refute his Book, and that that were to uſurp the right of Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> I keep my ſelf within the ſubject of this Letter.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe, you will pleaſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two things, which will ſhew you the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> in the Allegation of this paſſage.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That according to the truth of the Text he concludeth nothing, nor proveth at all the point, for which it is cited.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That even according to the falſe Latin Tranſlation, which Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath followed, it is alledged to ill purpoſe, and maketh nothing for the opinion of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>

                  </gap>heſe two truths; a little common ſenſe is ſufficient to diſcover their evidence.</p>
               <p>For firſt, all that can be drawn from the true place, is this, That the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is called the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that it is received kneeling. But this is not to any purpoſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if all thoſe who uſe this expreſſion and this ceremony, are of your Religion in this point, you will not finde many, againſt whom the claps of the fulminating Council of <hi>Trent</hi> can be juſtly directed, in regard that the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> receive the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> kneeling, and believe they eat the true Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and thoſe of our Communion in <hi>England</hi> take alſo the Sacrament on their knees; and there is not any Proteſtant perſon either in <hi>France</hi> or elſwhere, who doubts that he eateth and drinks truly and really the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> We onely differ about the manner of this Manducation; we diſtinguiſh the Sign from the thing ſignified, and we ſtick not to give to the Sacrament the name of the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> conformably to the words of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the more to note the truth and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Union there is betwixt them</p>
               <p>Whence you ſee, that ſuch kinde of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe, which in the Letter ſeem more conform to your Belief, are yet not contrary to ours; they have their warrantable uſe; they are very true according to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are not at all incompatible with our Sentiments: Which is plainly made out,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41826:38"/> in that we make uſe of them without ſcruple; and it is a Rule, which Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath laid down, and for the proof of which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For example, he ſaith, It is objected to us, that the Fathers have often called the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the <hi>Euchariſt, the Figure, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>types and Symbols of the Body of Chriſt;</hi> tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As for me, who examine onely what is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and the true difficulty, I inſiſt onely on the Suppoſition of the Book of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> which Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath undertaken to defend, and I maintain, that he hath not any Poſitive Proof, That in the Ninth and Tenth Age the people did adore the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What I ſay, may be eaſily verified; there needs no more but reading, and the peruſing of the places, where Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſpeaks of this <hi>Adoration.</hi>

               <p>Concerning the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he examines their Belief, during the Seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth Ages, in his Seventh Book; but of all that he alledges of the two laſt Age, which are in queſtion; there is nothing that can ſerve for his ſubject but the two examples, which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> had been

               <p>As to the Latin Church, Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> examines the Sentiments thereof, during the Age of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> in his Eighth Book; but there is not one word in it of the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Sacrament. Thus you ſee the Second Suppoſition of the Book of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together deſtitute of Poſitive Proofs. Let us now examine, whether the other Propoſitions of Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> are able to ſupply this defect.</p>
               <p>The ſecond (<hi>Pag.</hi> 74. of the Tenth Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.) contains the diſtinction between <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior</hi> and <hi>Exterior Adoration,</hi> and the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation he maketh, that the latter may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diverſified, and that there is not any <hi>Exterior</hi> ſign that is in its nature fixed to the

               <p>But this diſcourſe, which is very true, hath nothing that conduceth to the Queſtion, I grant, that the Feaſt of the Sacrament; the Sound of the Bell for advertizing the people to adore it, either at the Maſs, or when car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Streets; the Solemn Proceſſion, wherein it is publickly adored with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary pomp; the Confraternities eſtabliſhed for its honor; the expoſal of it made on Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars; are not marks abſolutely neceſſary of the <hi>Exterior Adoration;</hi> a Church that practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth none of all theſe Ceremonies, may adore the Sacrament, and uſe other tokens thereof. Nor hath Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> ſaid the contrary, in the manner Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, for to cauſe great exclamations againſt him.
